🚀 AI Audio Content Search Backend (RAG-based)
❓ Problem

Traditional keyword-based search fails for audio content and long-form transcripts.
Users cannot easily find relevant information using exact keywords, especially at scale.

✅ Solution

This project implements a backend system for semantic search and contextual answering using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.

The system:

Converts content into vector representations

Performs semantic similarity search

Generates responses strictly grounded in retrieved data (no hallucination)

🧰 Tech Stack (ACTUALLY USED)

Python

FastAPI – Backend REST APIs

SQLite – Story metadata storage

In-memory Vector Store (Python + NumPy logic) – Semantic search

RAG Architecture – Retrieve → Generate pipeline

Swagger / OpenAPI – API testing & demo

Docker – Containerized backend setup
